## How to build
In a Linux environment in the project root directory run `make`. This will compile server and client binaries in `output` directory. Make sure `gcc` and `make` packages are installed.
## How to run
### Client
Run `client` binary in the `output` directory
### Server
Run `server` binary in the `output` directory. The server binary needs an additional argument - the port number. For example, if you you want to run the server on port 2000, just run this command `server 2000`.
